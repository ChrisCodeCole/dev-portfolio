======================================
TO DO:
    1. Make bars more clickable
    2. Come up with an idea for initial loading of page (less boring landing page)
    3. Try out different configs for animation (definitely translate faster than scale)
    4. Sketch out idea for information regarding different projects...
        definitely trigger current project information to fade in after transition/scale animation completes
    5. Add a stylish border gradient to numbers detailing active work..
    6. Add overlay on images
