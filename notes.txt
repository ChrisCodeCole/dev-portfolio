======================================
TO DO:
    1. Make bars more clickable
    2. Come up with an idea for initial loading of page (less boring landing page)
    3. Try out different configs for animation (definitely translate faster than scale)
    4. Sketch out idea for information regarding different projects...
        definitely trigger current project information to fade in after transition/scale animation completes
    5. Add a stylish border gradient to numbers detailing active work..
    6. Add overlay on images, should be same color as background color 
        (really think about the styling on this..)
    7. Add default background color..sort out zindex...
======================================


======================================
CHANGE ANIMATION GOING TO CENTER:
    1. Make cards translate to center, card going in will translate while fading out quickly
        (gives vanishing appearance but you know it went to the middle)
    2. Change image height & width to match window instantly, and place overflow hidden on container
        (make sure image height & width update with window size)
        **Try 100vw * 100vh first for easy scaling and responsiveness..
    3. Animate container to fade in a 'tiny' bit, while scaling to match image size..
        (probably 1 to 0.9, maybe 0.8 for effect)
