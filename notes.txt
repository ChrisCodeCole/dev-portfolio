======================================
TO DO:
    1. Make bars more clickable
    2. Come up with an idea for initial loading of page (less boring landing page)
    3. Figure out how to translate cards to center of page
    4. Possibly create another component (or html element) to expand after card moves to center.
    5. Sketch out idea for information below different projects.
